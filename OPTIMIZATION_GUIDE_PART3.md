---

## Step 13: Behavioral Psychology Enhancements

### 1. Loss Aversion
**Application:** Emphasize what users lose by not acting
```
❌ Current: "Get your report free"
✅ Better: "Don't let evidence disappear – Get your report before it's too late"

Hero banner: "Don't Wait – Reports Get Harder to Find Over Time"
CTA microcopy: "Insurance claims have deadlines. Get your report now."
```

### 2. Social Proof
**Application:** Show that many others have taken action
```
- "Join 50,000+ accident victims who got their free report"
- "2,847 reports delivered in the last 7 days"
- "Sarah from Los Angeles got her report 5 minutes ago"
- "Real-time counter": "127 people are viewing their reports right now"
```

### 3. Authority Bias
**Application:** Display credentials and affiliations
```
- "Featured on [news outlets]"
- "A+ BBB Accredited Business"
- "Trusted by attorneys nationwide"
- "Certified by [security organization]"
- "Licensed data processors since 2020"
```

### 4. Risk Reversal
**Application:** Remove all perceived risk
```
- "Zero cost. Zero risk. Zero obligation."
- "No credit card required (seriously, we don't even have a place to enter one)"
- "You can delete your information anytime"
- "100% satisfaction guaranteed"
- "If we can't find your report, we'll help you request it manually – free"
```

### 5. Clarity Bias
**Application:** Make the process crystal clear
```
- Simple 3-step process with visual indicators
- "Takes 2 minutes" (exact time, not vague)
- "Answer 3 questions" (specific number)
- "Delivered in 5-15 minutes" (specific timeframe)
- Progress indicators: "Step 1 of 3 – You're almost done!"
```

### 6. Scarcity (Use Carefully)
**Application:** Create gentle urgency without false scarcity
```
✅ Real scarcity:
- "Reports older than 90 days may require additional processing time"
- "Insurance claim deadlines vary by state – don't delay"

❌ Fake scarcity (avoid):
- "Only 3 spots left!"
- "Offer expires in 1 hour!"
```

### 7. Reciprocity
**Application:** Give value first
```
- "Free report + Free legal consultation"
- "We'll also send you a guide: 'What to Do After an Accident'"
- "Access our 24/7 support team anytime"
- "No strings attached. We just want to help."
```

### 8. Anchoring
**Application:** Compare to expensive alternatives
```
- "Police departments charge $25-$75. We charge $0."
- "Legal consultations typically cost $200-$500/hour. Yours is free."
- "Other services charge $49.95. We don't charge anything."
```

### 9. Progress Indicators
**Application:** Show users how close they are
```
- "Step 1 of 3 – Almost there!"
- Progress bar: [████████░░] 80% Complete
- "Just 2 more questions and you're done!"
- Completion time: "30 seconds remaining"
```

### 10. Commitment & Consistency
**Application:** Start with small asks, build to larger ones
```
Progression:
1. "Tell us when your accident happened" (small ask)
2. "Where did it happen?" (still small)
3. "What's your name?" (slightly bigger)
4. "Email address to receive report" (bigger ask, but they're invested now)
5. "Would you like to speak with an attorney?" (final optional ask)
```
